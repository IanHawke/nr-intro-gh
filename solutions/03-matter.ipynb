Usually we expect any one single step in the calculation to be inaccurate either at the level of floating point accuracy (numbers can only be stored with a certain precision, typically 16 significant figures) or truncation accuracy (for example, approximations to derivatives have larger errors, depending on the grid size). We then typically expect errors to roughly add up in magnitude, slowly degrading the accuracy of the final result.\n",
