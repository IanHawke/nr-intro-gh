    "The key aspect of HPC is parallelism: multiple compute *cores* doing calculations at the same time. This breaks the problem into smaller pieces, solved independently, and then recombined. The problem is that the different parts of the problem need to communicate with each other, and this is much (much!) more expensive than the calculations themselves. This is the *communication* bottleneck.\n",
